# itp388_Sp24Proj
This is our group's project for ITP-388 in Spring 2024.

## Project Info
This project was compiled with the PlatformIO IDE extension in VSCode, so folders like `.vscode` or `test` were generated by the extension upon the creation of the project.

We used GitHub as we developed the software, and submitted it as part of our final deliverable in May 2024. However, I tidied up the repo (which required rebases) in August and September of 2024.

I also added the files we made that related to the hardware (3D-printing, PCBs, etc.) in the `Hardware` folder.
